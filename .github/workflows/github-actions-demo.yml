      # --- CRITICAL MISSING STEP FOR LOCALHOST TESTING ---
      # In a real CI environment, you must start your backend server here 
      # so that localhost:3000 is available for the tests.
      # Since your Lumino server code is Node.js, this is what that step would look like:
      
      - name: Start Lumino Backend Proxy Server (Mocked for CI)
        # Note: This is an example. To truly test, the service must run in the background.
        # This is often done using 'npm start &' or services/containers.
        # For simplicity in this demo, we assume the environment is properly configured 
        # to handle the localhost dependency.
        run: echo "Assuming Lumino server is started/mocked for CI"

      # Step 4: Run the Newman Tests
      - name: Run Lumino API Collection via Newman
        # NOTE: Paths are updated to reflect your 'postman/' folder structure
        run: |
          newman run postman/Lumino.postman_collection.json \
            -e postman/Lumino.postman_environment.json \
            -r cli,html \

      # Step 5: Upload the HTML report to GitHub Artifacts
